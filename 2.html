    <h3>WHY I MADE IT ?</h3>
      <p>I want to be an infosec professional. I'm still learning. Actually, I'm not good at programming skill or self study skill.
        But I have a goal. That is <strong>making an operating system</strong>, just like <strong><u>HACKNET</u></strong></p>
      <p>When I first played a game <strong>HACKNET</strong>, I was really shocked. Simple commands are very efficiant
         and effective. I don't know about high-level computing skills. But in this game, I could learn hacking easilly and
         did something useful. So I was really fascinated about that. If I have high-level computing skills, I will
         make an operating system. Just like <strong>HACKNET</strong>.</p>

      <p>I don't know about my future. But I guess I hope can be an infosec professional.</p>
      <p>So I made this website for training and you're looking at it</p>
